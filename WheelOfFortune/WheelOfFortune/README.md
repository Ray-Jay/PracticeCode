## How to Play

Three players take turns guessing letters in a word puzzle. To guess a consonant,
the wheel must be spun first and a dollar amount returned. For each consonant
correctly guessed, the dollar amount is accumulated during the round. 
If they guess a consonant that's not in the puzzle, play passes to the next person.
If a player wishes to guess a vowel, they do not spin. Instead, the player pays 
$250 to have all occurrences of that vowel shown in the puzzle. If a player can 
solve the puzzle, they can do so on their turn and win the money they have 
accumulated. Only the player who solves the puzzle gets to keep the money for 
that round.
